What was the hardest part to understand?
    Is feels deceptively simple to understand this code. The naming conventions are clear and "this" straightforwardly refers to the constructor named. My issue comes from writing the code without having a reference like this, because suddenly I don't remember if it was a bracket or a {}, or if my indentation is off, or if I need to add an equals sign at this spot.
How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?
    This code uses "this" to make data super flexible and customizable to user input/behavior. The code feels a lot more dynamic, scalable, and responsive because it is able to integrate a new constructor easily.
What would you do differently if you wrote this object from scratch?
    One simple change I would make for peace of mind is to move the showArray function up, so that I could have it written and ready to double-check on my work for other functions like addSong.
